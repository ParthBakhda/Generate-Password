# Generate-Password
Password Generator 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? My motivation was to create proper java code that worked well with the starter code to randomly generate passwords and that meets the criteria of acceptance.
- Why did you build this project? I built this project to challenge myself and understand how to utilize different elements and how to incorporate them. 
- What problem does it solve? Problem it solves is it creates a random password using the proper criterias and generates a password.
- What did you learn? I learned the value of if and else codes and how to use console.log properly and the components of java code.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. First I had to research proper if and else statements and how to use them then construct proper lines of code that utilize the elements properly. Then I had to make proper java code to match the html and css code so it can work in conjunction to each other. I had to do lots of trails and errors to get the code to really work.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here. Sections divided into about me, work, projects and contact.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
